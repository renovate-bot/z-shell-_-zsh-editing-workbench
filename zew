${h1}Key Bindings${rst}

Zew provides organized key bindings for various command line editing
features, and also provides some of the features (not existing in all
Zsh versions, or having limitations or bugs). Original features are used
to make user not depart from mainstream Zsh.

The key bindings are below. Original features are marked by
blue color set on the key shortcut:

1. ${h2}Alt-w${rst}   - delete a ${h4}shell word${rst} (what's a shell word is explained in
             following section)
2. ${h2}Alt-t${rst}   - transpose (swap) ${h4}shell words${rst}
3. ${h3}Alt-m${rst}   - copy previous ${h4}shell word${rst}, or word before that, etc. when
             used multiple times
4. ${h3}Alt-M${rst}   - just copy previous ${h4}shell word${rst} without iterating to
             previous ones
5. ${h3}Alt-.${rst}   - copy last ${h4}shell word${rst} from previous line, or line before
             that, etc. when used multiple times; can be combined with
             ${h3}Alt-m${rst}
6. ${h3}Ctrl-W${rst}  - delete word according to configured ${h4}word style${rst} (what's the
             style is explained in following section)
7. ${h3}Alt-r${rst}   - transpose (swap) words according to configured ${h4}word style${rst}
             (cursor needs to be placed on beginning of word to swap)
8. ${h3}Alt-/${rst}   - complete ${h4}some word${rst} from history (explained in next section)
9. ${h2}Alt-h/H${rst} - complete ${h4}shell word${rst} from history (custom version)
10. ${h3}Ctrl-J${rst}  - break line
11. ${h3}Ctrl-_${rst}  - undo


${h1}Definitions${rst}

A ${h4}shell word${rst} is a text that Zsh would see as single segment. For example
\$(( i + 1 )) is a single shell word.

A ${h4}word style${rst} defines a way Zsh recognizes segments (words) of text in
commands that want to use the style information. The style can be
configured in zew.conf to be one of:

- bash       words are built up of alphanumeric characters only
- normal     as in normal shell operation: word characters are
             alphanumeric characters plus any characters present in the
             string given by the parameter \$WORDCHARS
- shell      words are complete shell command arguments, possibly
             including complete quoted strings, or any tokens special to
             the shell
- whitespace words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace
- default    restore the default settings; this is the same as 'normal'
             with default \$WORDCHARS

${h4}Some word${rst} is in general a sophisticated word, but not a shell word,
because of limitations in Zsh history word completion. ${h4}Some word${rst} is
rather not build from special characters, it works well for normal
characters.
